Scope: Integration of Bot1 & Bot6 optimization monitoring with existing Bot3/Bot5 framework

================================================================================
WHAT THIS UPDATE PROVIDES
================================================================================

1. BOT1 & BOT6 SPECIFIC MONITORING
   - 24-hour minimum thresholds (win rate, trade count, trailing stop validation)
   - 48-hour completion criteria (P&L targets, fee efficiency, trade frequency)
   - Portfolio-level criteria (correlation risk, system P&L degradation)
   - Metrics specific to each optimization type (trailing stops, ROI exits)

2. CONSOLIDATED CHECKPOINT FRAMEWORK
   - 24-Hour Checkpoint: Oct 31, 10:21 UTC
     * Bot1 minimum: 55% win rate, 5+ trades, trailing stop working
     * Bot6 minimum: 60% win rate, 6+ trades, ROI exits >=50%
     * Portfolio: Combined P&L >-2.00 USDT, no degradation in others
   
   - 48-Hour Checkpoint: Nov 1, 10:27 UTC
     * Bot1 completion: >=60% win rate, >=10 trades, P&L >=+5.00 USDT
     * Bot6 completion: >=65% win rate, 3-4x trade frequency, P&L >=+4.00 USDT
     * Portfolio: No pair correlation >0.88, Phase 2 completion decision

3. SQL QUERIES FOR BOT1 & BOT6
   - Query 1A: Bot1 performance snapshot (24/48h)
   - Query 1B: Bot6 performance snapshot (24/48h)
   - Query 2: Trade frequency validation (Bot6 efficiency)
   - Query 3: Correlation impact analysis (Bot1 vs Bot3, Bot6 vs Bot5)
   - Query 4: Trailing stop effectiveness (both bots)
   - Query 5: Risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe/Sortino ratios)

4. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING FRAMEWORK
   - No changes to Bot3 & Bot5 monitoring (continue existing protocol)
   - Combined P&L tracking for all 4 optimized bots
   - Portfolio-level correlation matrix construction
   - System-wide diversification benefit calculation

5. DECISION TREES & PROCEDURES
   - 24-hour decision tree: Continue/Rollback individual bots
   - 48-hour decision tree: Phase 2 completion/extension/rollback
   - Emergency rollback procedures (exact bash commands)
   - Critical alert triggers requiring immediate intervention

6. REPORTING TEMPLATES
   - 24-hour checkpoint report template (standardized format)
   - 48-hour final report template (statistical validation)
   - Execution checklist (what to run at each checkpoint)
   - Technical reference (database locations, parameter verification)
