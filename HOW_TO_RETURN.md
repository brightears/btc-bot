## Performance Analysis (After 2-3 Days)

**When to use:** You've waited 2-3 days since Oct 15 for stable trading data accumulation.

**Template:**
```
Hey Claude, I'm back after [X] days. Can you analyze the performance of our 6 trading bots?

Starting point:
- Checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md
- Git commit: 4840ec9
- Bots running since: Oct 15, 2025, 03:00 AM UTC

Please analyze:
1. **BTC bots** (Bot 1-3): Which strategy performed best?
2. **PAXG bots** (Bot 4-6): Which strategy performed best?
3. **BTC vs PAXG**: Which asset is more profitable overall?
4. **Trade statistics**: Win rates, P&L, trade frequency for each bot
5. **Concerns**: Any worrying patterns, bugs, or issues?
6. **Recommendation**: Continue testing, adjust strategies, or prepare for live trading?

[Optional: Attach any Telegram screenshots if you received alerts]
```

**What Claude will do:**
1. SSH to VPS and query all 6 bot databases
2. Extract trade history, wins/losses, P&L for each bot
3. Calculate win rates, profit factors, and other metrics
4. Compare strategies and asset classes
5. Provide detailed performance report
6. Recommend next steps

## Troubleshooting Telegram Alerts

**When to use:** You received Telegram alerts about bot crashes or memory issues.

**Template:**
```
Claude, I received Telegram alerts. Can you investigate?

Alert details:
- Type: [Bot restart alert / Memory critical / All bots down]
- Time: [When you saw the alert]
- Frequency: [How many times / ongoing]
- Screenshot: [Paste Telegram screenshot if available]

System checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md
Git commit: 4840ec9

Please check:
1. Are all 6 bots currently running?
2. What's the memory status? (free -h)
3. Any errors in bot logs?
4. What caused the crashes?
5. Is this a one-time issue or recurring problem?
6. Do I need to take action, or is auto-restart handling it?
```

**Example alert scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Frequent restart alerts**
```
Alert received:
üö® BOT ALERT: bot3_simplersi restarted 6 times in last hour!
Monitor immediately: ssh root@5.223.55.219

My message to Claude:
"Claude, I got 6 restart alerts for bot3. Is this the memory issue again?
Checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md"
```

**Scenario 2: Memory critical**
```
Alert received:
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory critical! Only 45MB available. Swap: 1.9GB used.

My message to Claude:
"Claude, memory critical alert. Should I upgrade to 4GB RAM now?
Checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md"
```

**Scenario 3: All bots down**
```
Alert received:
üö® CRITICAL: All 6 bots are DOWN! Manual intervention required.

My message to Claude:
"Claude, all 6 bots crashed. Please investigate and restart.
Checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md"
```

## Bots Not Trading

**When to use:** Bots haven't made any trades for an unusually long time.

**Template:**
```
Claude, the bots haven't traded in [X hours/days]. Can you check if they're working?

Observation:
- Last trade I saw: [Date/time or "I don't remember seeing any trades"]
- Expected: Should see 8-12 trades/day across all 6 bots
- Duration: It's been [X hours/days] with no activity

System checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md
Git commit: 4840ec9

Please investigate:
1. Are all 6 bots running and healthy?
2. Are they analyzing market data properly?
3. Any errors preventing trade execution?
4. Is this normal for current market conditions (ranging/low volatility)?
5. Should I be concerned or is this expected behavior?
```

**Possible causes Claude will check:**
- Bots crashed (monitoring should have restarted them)
- Market is ranging (no clear signals)
- Strategy conditions not met
- Exchange connectivity issues
- Configuration errors

## Going Live (After 4+ Weeks)

**When to use:** You've tested for 4+ weeks, results look good, ready to trade with real money.

**Template:**
```
Claude, it's been [X] weeks since we started. Dry-run results look [excellent/good/promising].

Performance summary (my observations):
- Overall P&L: [Estimate if you tracked it]
- Best performing bot: [If you noticed one doing well]
- System stability: [Any issues or smooth sailing?]

System checkpoint: CHECKPOINT_2025_10_15.md
Git commit: 4840ec9

I'm thinking about going live with real money. Please help prepare:

1. **Review 4-week performance**: Is it good enough to go live?
   - What are the actual win rates for each bot?
   - Which bot(s) should I deploy live?
   - Any red flags that say "don't do it yet"?

2. **Recommend VPS upgrade**: Should I upgrade to 4GB RAM before going live?
   - Current: 2GB + 2GB swap
   - Cost: ~‚Ç¨5-10/month more
   - Benefits and necessity?

3. **Create go-live checklist**: What do I need to do?
   - Start with how much capital? ($500? $1000?)
   - Deploy all 6 bots or just best performer?
   - What settings to change (dry_run: false, etc.)?
   - Safety measures to have in place?

4. **Risk management**: How to minimize risk?
   - Position sizing
   - Stop-loss verification
   - Monitoring frequency during first week
```

**What Claude will do:**
1. Analyze full 4-week performance history
2. Calculate comprehensive statistics
3. Identify best performing strategies
4. Recommend VPS upgrade (strongly advised before live trading)
5. Create detailed go-live checklist
6. Set up enhanced monitoring for live trading

Please verify:
1. All 6 bots running? (ps count)
2. Memory healthy? (free -h)
3. Any recent alerts or issues?
