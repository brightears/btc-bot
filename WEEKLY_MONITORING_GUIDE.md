## 📱 Daily Monitoring (5 minutes)

### What You Should See in Telegram

**Normal Activity:**
```
✅ Entry Alert: BTC/USDT at $XX,XXX
✅ Exit Alert: +$2.50 profit (+2.5%)
✅ Status: 1 open trade
```

**Expected Frequency:**
- **Trades**: 5-15 per day (depending on market volatility)
- **Notifications**: Every trade entry/exit
- **Status updates**: Bot heartbeat in logs (you don't need to check logs unless issues)

### Daily Checklist

**Morning (2 minutes):**
- [ ] Open Telegram
- [ ] Check for any trade notifications overnight
- [ ] Send `/daily` command
- [ ] Note: Win rate, number of trades, P&L

**Evening (3 minutes):**
- [ ] Review day's performance
- [ ] Screenshot any interesting trades or patterns
- [ ] Note if anything seems unusual

### Key Metrics to Track

Create a simple spreadsheet or note:

| Date | Trades | Wins | Losses | P&L | Balance | Notes |
|------|--------|------|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| Oct 7 | 3 | 2 | 1 | +$1.50 | $10,001.50 | First day |
| Oct 8 | 8 | 5 | 3 | +$4.20 | $10,005.70 | |
| Oct 9 | 6 | 3 | 3 | -$0.80 | $10,004.90 | |

**Or simply track in Telegram:**
- `/profit` - Shows cumulative P&L
- `/daily` - Shows today's stats
- `/balance` - Shows current balance

## 🤖 Multi-Bot Monitoring (Week 2+)

**Starting Week 2 (Oct 13), we're running 3 strategies in parallel:**
- Bot 1: Strategy001 (Trend following) - **Telegram ENABLED** ✅
- Bot 2: Strategy004 (Hybrid multi-indicator) - **Telegram DISABLED** ❌
- Bot 3: SimpleRSI (Mean reversion) - **Telegram DISABLED** ❌

**Important:** Only Bot 1 sends Telegram notifications. Bot 2 & Bot 3 trade silently.
- You'll see Bot 1 trades in Telegram
- Bot 2 & Bot 3 data must be checked via VPS logs or weekly Claude analysis

### Daily Multi-Bot Checklist

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- [ ] Check Telegram for ALL 3 bots (look for bot name in messages)
- [ ] Send `/status` to each bot separately
- [ ] Note which bots have open trades

**Evening (10 minutes):**
- [ ] Send `/profit` to Bot1, Bot2, Bot3
- [ ] Update tracking spreadsheet with all 3 P&Ls
- [ ] Compare performance: which bot is winning today?

### Tracking Spreadsheet Format

| Date | Bot1 P/L | Bot2 P/L | Bot3 P/L | Combined | Winner | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Oct 13 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | - | First day |
| Oct 14 | +$2.50 | -$0.80 | +$1.20 | +$2.90 | Bot1 | Bot1 trending well |

### Weekly Comparison (Sundays)

**Calculate for EACH bot:**
- Win rate
- Total P/L
- Number of trades
- Best/worst trade

**Example:**
```
Bot1 (Strategy001):
- Win Rate: 60%
- P/L: +$12.50
- Trades: 7
- Winner: Bot1 🏆

Bot2 (Strategy004):
- Win Rate: 55%
- P/L: +$8.30
- Trades: 5

Bot3 (SimpleRSI):
- Win Rate: 35%
- P/L: -$4.20
- Trades: 22
```

**Decision:** Deploy Bot1 (Strategy001) as main strategy for Week 3

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs (Everything Normal)

**Per-Bot Expectations:**
- **Bot1 (Strategy001):** 0.7 trades/day, 60-75% win rate, longer holds
- **Bot2 (Strategy004):** 0.5 trades/day, 60-70% win rate, short holds
- **Bot3 (SimpleRSI):** 3 trades/day, 35-45% win rate, frequent trades

**Combined:**
- **Trade Frequency**: 4-7 trades per day across all bots
- **At Least 1 Bot Positive**: Not all bots need to win, but at least 1 should be positive
- **Max Single Loss**: ≤$6 for Bot1/Bot2, ≤$2 for Bot3
- **No Error Messages**: All 3 bots run smoothly

### ⚠️ Warning Signs (Needs Attention)

- **Win Rate <30%** after 50+ trades → Strategy not working for current market
- **Too Many Trades** (>30/day) → Overtrading, adjust strategy
- **Too Few Trades** (0-2/day) → Market ranging, strategy can't find signals
- **All Trades Hitting Stop-Loss** → Entry logic broken
- **Trades Not Closing** (open >4 hours) → Exit logic issue
- **Balance Dropping >5%** in 3 days → Performance problem

### 🚨 Red Flags (Immediate Action)

- **Bot Stops Responding** → Check if process died
- **Error Messages in Telegram** → Share with Claude immediately
- **Balance Dropping >10%** → Stop bot, investigate
- **Same Trade Opening Repeatedly** → Logic bug, stop immediately
- **No Telegram Messages for >24 hours** → Bot or Telegram connection issue

## 📊 Weekly Performance Review

### When to Review
**Every Sunday** (or 7 days after start)

### What to Check

**1. Send Telegram Commands:**
```
/profit - Get weekly P&L
/weekly - Weekly statistics
/performance - Strategy performance breakdown
```

**2. Calculate Key Metrics:**

| Metric | How to Calculate | Good Target |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Win Rate | (Wins / Total Trades) × 100 | 45-60% |
| Profit Factor | Total Wins $ / Total Losses $ | >1.2 |
| Average Win | Total Win $ / Number of Wins | $2-5 |
| Average Loss | Total Loss $ / Number of Losses | $0.50-1 |
| Max Drawdown | Largest balance drop from peak | <5% |
| Weekly Return | (Current Balance - Start) / Start | 0-5% |

**3. Ask Yourself:**
- [ ] Is the strategy consistently profitable?
- [ ] Is the win rate acceptable?
- [ ] Are losses controlled (staying within stop-loss)?
- [ ] Any concerning patterns?
- [ ] Ready to continue another week?

## 🔄 Weekly Strategy Rotation

### When to Request Rotation

**Automatic Schedule**: Every Sunday after reviewing performance

### How to Request Rotation from Claude

Here's this week's performance:

[Attach Telegram screenshots of /weekly and /profit]
```

**Claude will:**
1. SSH into your VPS

3. Show you backtest results for all strategies
4. Tell you which strategy scored best
5. Switch to new strategy if better than current
6. Restart bot with new strategy
7. Confirm everything is running

**What You'll See:**
```
Backtesting Results:
- SimpleRSI: Score 18.5 (current)
