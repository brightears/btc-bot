### Weekly Comparison (Sundays)

**Ask Claude to analyze performance:**
```
Hey Claude, can you analyze this week's performance for all 6 bots?

Please compare:
1. BTC bots (Bot 1-3): Which performed best?
2. PAXG bots (Bot 4-6): Which performed best?
3. Overall: BTC vs PAXG - which is more profitable?
```

**Calculate for EACH bot:**
- Win rate
- Total P/L
- Number of trades
- Best/worst trade
- Average profit per trade

**Example Weekly Summary:**
```
BTC Bots:
- Bot1 (Strategy001): 60% win rate, +$12.50 P/L, 7 trades üèÜ
- Bot2 (Strategy004): 55% win rate, +$8.30 P/L, 5 trades

```

**Decision:** Identify top performers for potential live trading
