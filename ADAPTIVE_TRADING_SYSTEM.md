# Adaptive Self-Optimizing Trading System

**Status:** Research Complete | Implementation: Planned for Post-Oct 28 Analysis
**Research Date:** October 18, 2025
**Estimated Timeline:** 6-8 months incremental build
**Estimated Effort:** 75-105 hours developer time

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a vision for evolving the current 6-bot Freqtrade system into a fully adaptive, self-optimizing trading laboratory. The system will:

- **Auto-detect and pause** underperforming live strategies before significant losses
- **Continuously discover** new profitable strategies via genetic algorithms or mining
- **Auto-test candidates** in a 3-tier pipeline (Backtest → Dry-run → Live)
- **Auto-rotate** strategies between 3 Live bots (real money) and 7 Testing bots (dry-run)
- **Self-improve** without manual intervention, adapting to changing market conditions

**Key Insight:** We already have 80% of the required infrastructure through existing agents (market-regime-detector, strategy-selector, performance-analyzer, risk-guardian). The remaining 20% is orchestration and automation logic.

**Why This Matters:** Even one consistently profitable strategy discovered by automation can generate 5-10% annual returns, paying for itself many times over. The system becomes a continuous strategy R&D lab.

## Vision & Goals

### The "Set It and Forget It" Trading Lab

**Core Philosophy:** Transform the trading bot from a static system requiring manual oversight into a dynamic, self-improving organism that adapts to market changes, discovers new opportunities, and protects capital automatically.

### Primary Goals

1. **Capital Protection**
   - Detect strategy degradation within days (not weeks/months)
   - Auto-pause underperforming strategies before significant drawdowns
   - Prevent "slow bleed" scenarios where bad strategies quietly lose money

2. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Always have 7 candidate strategies in testing
   - Automatically discover 10-20 new strategies per month
   - Promote only the best performers to live trading

3. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Reduce manual monitoring from daily → weekly → monthly
   - Automated rotation decisions based on quantitative metrics
   - Human oversight only for major system changes

4. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**
   - Maintain 3 live strategies with low correlation
   - Ensure portfolio diversity (not all strategies fail simultaneously)
   - Optimize for Sharpe ratio, not just absolute returns

---

## Current System vs Future State

### Current State (Oct 18, 2025)

**Architecture:**
- 6 bots running (3 BTC, 3 PAXG)
- All in dry-run mode with $3,000 virtual capital each
- Manual strategy selection and configuration
- Weekly performance reviews required
- Human decides when to rotate strategies

**Limitations:**
- No automatic detection of strategy failure
- New strategies must be manually discovered and tested
- No systematic promotion/demotion process
- Risk of "analysis paralysis" - too much data, unclear decisions
- Time-intensive manual oversight

### Future State (Target: Q2-Q3 2026)

**Architecture:**
- 10 bots running: 3 Live (real money) + 7 Testing (dry-run)
- Auto-pause system detects and stops underperforming strategies
- Genetic algorithm or mining generates new strategies weekly
- Automated 3-tier testing pipeline validates candidates
- Monthly auto-rotation between Live and Testing pools

**Benefits:**
- **Autonomous operation:** System runs for months without intervention
- **Faster adaptation:** New strategies promoted within 60 days (vs manual 3-6 months)
- **Risk reduction:** Degrading strategies stopped within days (vs weeks/months)
- **Continuous R&D:** Always searching for better strategies
- **Scalable:** Easy to expand to 20-30 bots as capital grows

## Research Foundations

### Part 1: Auto-Pause Systems

**Problem:** How do we automatically detect when a live strategy stops working?

**Solution 1: Drawdown Limits**

Research shows the most common trigger is **2x historical maximum drawdown**.

- **Logic:** If backtest max drawdown was 15%, pause at 30% live drawdown
- **Why 2x?** Accounts for randomness but catches true degradation
- **Industry Practice:** Used by prop trading firms and hedge funds

**Solution 2: Performance Divergence Detection**

Compare live vs backtest performance in rolling windows:
- If live win rate <70% of backtest win rate → Warning
- If live Sharpe ratio <50% of backtest Sharpe → Pause
- Monitor: Win rate, profit factor, average win/loss ratio

**Solution 3: Statistical Degradation Tests**

- Run Monte Carlo simulation on backtest to generate expected performance distribution
- Pause if current live performance falls outside 95% confidence interval
- More sophisticated than simple "2x drawdown" but requires more computation

**Solution 4: Market Regime Mismatch**

- Strategy optimized for "trending" markets but regime switched to "ranging"
- Auto-pause when current regime doesn't match strategy's optimal conditions
- **We already have this:** `market-regime-detector` agent can do this!

**Research Sources:**
- Quantified Strategies: "Drawdown Management" (2024)
- Tradetron Blog: "7 Risk-Management Techniques for Algo Traders" (2024)
- Academic paper: "Data-Driven Drawdown Control with Restart Mechanism" (2023)

### Part 2: Strategy Discovery (Genetic Algorithms)

**Problem:** How do we continuously find new profitable strategies?

**Solution: Genetic Algorithm Evolution**

Research shows genetic algorithms (GAs) can evolve profitable trading strategies automatically.

**How It Works:**

1. **Generate Population** (100-500 random strategies)
   - Randomize: indicator combos, parameters, entry/exit rules

2. **Backtest Each Strategy** on historical data

3. **Score by Fitness Function**
   - Example: `Fitness = (Sharpe Ratio × 0.4) + (Win Rate × 0.3) + (Profit Factor × 0.3) - (Max Drawdown × 0.5)`

4. **Select Top Performers** (top 20%)

5. **Breed New Strategies**
   - **Crossover:** Combine indicator sets from two parents
   - **Mutation:** Randomly modify parameters (RSI period 14 → 21)

6. **Repeat for 50-100 Generations**

**Real-World Results:**
- GeneTrader project (GitHub): Found strategies with Sharpe >2.0
- Academic research: Outperformed hand-crafted strategies by 15-30%
- Trading firms: Use GAs for parameter optimization routinely

**What Gets Optimized:**
- Indicator combinations (RSI + MACD + Bollinger, etc.)
- Indicator parameters (RSI period, MACD fast/slow, etc.)
- Entry/exit logic (crossover, threshold levels, patterns)
- Position sizing rules
- Risk management parameters (stop-loss %, take-profit %)

**Alternative: Strategy Mining**

Instead of generating strategies, scrape existing ones:
- GitHub freqtrade-strategies repository (1000+ strategies)
- TradingView public scripts
- Quantopian/QuantConnect archives

Auto-backtest all, promote best performers to Testing pool.

**Research Sources:**
- Medium: "Using Genetic Algorithms to Build Stock Trading Strategies" (2024)
- GitHub: GeneTrader, imsatoshi projects
- Academic: "Designing Safe, Profitable Automated Trading Agents Using Evolutionary Algorithms"

### Part 3: Testing Pipeline

**Problem:** How do we validate new strategies before risking real money?

**Solution: 3-Tier Validation Pipeline**

```
Tier 1: BACKTEST (Historical Data, Minutes)
↓ Pass Criteria: Sharpe >1.5, Win Rate >45%, Max DD <25%
Tier 2: DRY-RUN (Paper Trading, 30-60 days)
↓ Pass Criteria: Performance >70% of backtest, No execution bugs
Tier 3: LIVE MICRO (Real Money $100-500, 30 days)
↓ Pass Criteria: Confirm profitability, Stable execution
Tier 4: LIVE FULL (Scale to Full Allocation)
```

**Promotion Criteria (From Research):**

| Metric | Backtest | Dry-Run | Live Micro |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| Sharpe Ratio | >1.5 | >1.2 | >1.0 |
| Win Rate | >45% | >40% | >38% |
| Max Drawdown | <25% | <30% | <35% |
| Profit Factor | >1.5 | >1.3 | >1.2 |
| Sample Size | 100+ trades | 50+ trades | 30+ trades |

**Auto-Dismissal Triggers:**

Kill a strategy if:
- Dry-run performance <50% of backtest (likely overfit)
- Max drawdown exceeds 2x backtest max DD
- Win rate drops >20% below backtest
- 3 consecutive losing weeks
- Execution errors (API failures, timeouts)

**Research Sources:**
- Optional Alpha: "When & How to Transition from Paper to Live Autotrading"
- Freqtrade docs: Walk-forward analysis methodology
- Hedge fund best practices (mirror portfolio approach)

### Part 4: Dynamic Bot Allocation

**Problem:** How do we allocate capital between proven and experimental strategies?

**Solution: Portfolio Rotation Strategy**

**Architecture:**

```
LIVE POOL (3 bots, real money)
├─ Bot 1: Best performer (40% capital)
├─ Bot 2: Second best (30% capital)
└─ Bot 3: Third best (20% capital)
Reserve: 10% cash (safety buffer)

TESTING POOL (7 bots, dry-run)
├─ Candidates 1-3: Recently promoted from backtest
├─ Candidates 4-5: Established strategies being re-validated
└─ Candidates 6-7: Experimental new strategies
```

**Rotation Rules:**

**Weekly Review (Sundays, Automated):**
1. Rank all 10 bots by 30-day Sharpe ratio
2. If Testing bot outperforms worst Live bot for 4 consecutive weeks:
   - Demote worst Live bot → Testing pool
   - Promote best Testing bot → Live pool (start with 20% allocation)
3. If Live bot underperforms for 2 consecutive weeks:
   - Reduce capital by 50%, reallocate to top performer

**Monthly Deep Review:**
- Kill bottom 2 Testing bots (replace with new discoveries)
- Rebalance Live capital based on recent performance
- Check strategy correlation (ensure diversity)
- Generate performance report for human review

**Capital Allocation Example ($10,000):**

| Bot Tier | % | Amount | Risk Level |
|----------|---|--------|------------|
| Live #1 (Top) | 40% | $4,000 | Proven |
| Live #2 (Second) | 30% | $3,000 | Proven |
| Live #3 (Third) | 20% | $2,000 | Validation |
| Reserve | 10% | $1,000 | Safety |
| Testing (7 bots) | 0% | Virtual $3k each | No risk |

**Research Sources:**
- Interactive Brokers: Portfolio rebalancing automation
- E*TRADE Core Portfolios: Auto-rebalancing at 5% drift
- Hedge fund practices: Shadow portfolios for validation

**Tasks:**
1. Enhance `risk-guardian` agent:
   - Add real-time drawdown monitoring (check every 15 min)
   - Add performance divergence detection (compare vs backtest)
   - Add pause triggers (DD, win rate, Sharpe thresholds)
   - Add Telegram alerts for pause events

2. Create strategy performance database:
   - Track daily metrics for each live strategy
   - Store backtest baseline for comparison
   - Log pause/resume events with timestamps

3. Add Freqtrade integration:
   - Script to disable new entries when pause triggered
   - Webhook or API call to close open positions
   - Manual resume process (safety feature)

**Deliverables:**
- Live strategies auto-pause when degradation detected
- Telegram alerts on pause events
- Database tracking of all pause/resume actions
- Documentation on pause criteria and override process

**Effort:** 10-15 hours
**VPS:** Can use existing 4GB setup
**Risk:** Low - adds safety, doesn't change trading logic

---

### Phase 2: Testing Pipeline (Month 3-4)

**Goal:** Systematically test new strategies before risking real capital

**Tasks:**
1. Upgrade VPS to 8GB RAM (~€25/month)
   - Run 3 Live + 7 Dry-run bots simultaneously
   - Configure 7 separate dry-run bot directories
   - Each with unique config, $3k virtual capital

2. Create `strategy-testing-orchestrator` agent:
   - Manage strategy tier assignments (Backtest/Dry-run/Live)
   - Track performance in each tier
   - Auto-promote/demote based on criteria
   - Generate weekly testing reports

3. Build promotion/demotion logic:
   - Weekly cron job (Sundays, 1:00 AM)
   - Calculate metrics for all Testing bots
   - Generate rotation recommendations
   - Require human approval initially (semi-automated)

**Deliverables:**
- 7 dry-run bot slots running 24/7
- Automated testing pipeline tracking 10+ strategies
- Weekly reports on candidate performance
- Semi-automated promotion system (human approval required)

**Effort:** 20-30 hours
**VPS:** 8GB RAM (~€25/month, +€12 from current)
**Risk:** Medium - more bots, more complexity

---

### Phase 3: Strategy Discovery (Month 5-6)

**Goal:** Continuously generate new strategy candidates

**Option A: Strategy Mining (Recommended for Phase 3)**

**Tasks:**
1. Create `strategy-miner` agent:
   - Scrape GitHub freqtrade-strategies weekly
   - Filter new/updated strategies
   - Auto-backtest on standard dataset
   - Add top performers (Sharpe >1.5) to Testing pool

2. Build backtest automation:
   - Standardized backtest period (12 months)
   - Consistent capital, fees, slippage assumptions
   - Quality filters (min 100 trades, max DD <25%)
   - Generate comparison reports

3. Add strategy storage:
   - Download strategy .py files automatically
   - Version control for all tested strategies
   - Track backtest results in database
   - Tag strategies by source (GitHub, custom, evolved)

**Deliverables:**
- 10-20 new candidate strategies per month
- Automated backtest quality reports
- Growing library of tested strategies
- Reduced manual strategy research time

**Effort:** 15-20 hours
**VPS:** Same 8GB setup
**Risk:** Low - only adds to Testing pool, doesn't affect Live

**Option B: Genetic Algorithm (Advanced)**

**Tasks:**
1. Create `strategy-evolver` agent:
   - Implement GA framework (population, fitness, crossover, mutation)
   - Define strategy parameter space
   - Integrate with Freqtrade hyperopt
   - Run 50 generations, take top 5% as candidates

**Effort:** 30-40 hours (more complex)
**Benefit:** Can discover novel strategies humans wouldn't conceive
**Risk:** Higher complexity, potential overfitting

**Recommendation:** Start with Strategy Mining (Option A), add GA later if needed

---

### Phase 4: Full Automation (Month 7-8)

**Goal:** Remove human-in-the-loop, fully autonomous rotation

**Tasks:**
1. Remove approval gates:
   - Auto-execute promotions (instead of recommendations)
   - Strict criteria: 4 weeks outperformance + low correlation
   - Safety limit: Max 1 promotion per week

2. Add advanced safety guardrails:
   - Emergency kill switch (Telegram command: "/pause-automation")
   - Correlation checker (reject if >0.7 with existing Live)
   - Capital allocation limits (max 40% per strategy)
   - Reversion to manual mode if 2 failed promotions in a row

3. Build comprehensive monitoring:
   - Daily health check emails
   - Weekly performance summary (all 10 bots)
   - Monthly deep dive report (strategy lifecycle, rotation history)
   - Quarterly review prompt (human oversight checkpoint)

**Deliverables:**
- Fully autonomous rotation system
- 3 Live + 7 Testing bots self-optimizing continuously
- Comprehensive monitoring and reporting
- "Set it and forget it" operation with safety nets

**Effort:** 15-20 hours
**VPS:** Same 8GB setup (could upgrade to 16GB for 20 bots)
**Risk:** Medium-High - full automation requires extensive testing

---

## Resource Requirements

### VPS Upgrade Path

| Phase | RAM | CPU | Monthly Cost | Bots | Purpose |

| Data storage | Included | Included | 40GB disk plenty |
| **Total** | **€25** | **€300** | +€144/year vs current |

**ROI Calculation:**
- If system finds 1 strategy with 5% annual return on $10k: $500/year
- Cost: €300/year (~$325)
- Net benefit: $175/year (54% ROI on infrastructure)
- If 2 strategies found: $1,000 - $325 = $675 profit (207% ROI)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Over-Optimization (Curve-Fitting)

**Problem:** Genetic algorithms or excessive optimization create strategies that work perfectly on historical data but fail in live trading.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Walk-Forward Analysis:** Require 3+ periods (train on 6mo, test on 2mo, repeat)
2. **Out-of-Sample Testing:** Hold out 20% of data, never shown to optimization
3. **60-Day Dry-Run Validation:** All strategies must prove themselves in paper trading
4. **Correlation Rejection:** Reject strategies with >0.7 correlation to existing Live bots
5. **Parameter Limits:** Max 10 optimizable parameters per strategy
6. **Fitness Complexity Penalty:** Strategies with 15+ parameters get fitness penalty

**Confidence Level:** High - these are industry-standard practices

---

### Risk 2: Slow Degradation Goes Unnoticed

**Problem:** Live strategy slowly deteriorates over weeks, losing money before auto-pause triggers.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Daily Checks:** Monitor performance every 15 minutes (not just weekly)
2. **Tighter Thresholds:** Pause at 1.5x historical DD (instead of 2x)
3. **Multiple Signals:** Require 2+ degradation indicators (DD + win rate)
4. **Early Warning:** Reduce capital allocation by 50% as warning (before full pause)
5. **Trailing Baselines:** Update "expected performance" baseline quarterly

**Confidence Level:** Medium - requires tuning, false positives possible

---

### Risk 3: Testing Pool Becomes Stale

**Problem:** All 7 testing bots underperform, no good candidates for promotion.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Continuous Discovery:** Generate 10-20 new candidates per month (mining or GA)
2. **Diversity Requirements:** Test strategies with different approaches (trend/mean-reversion/breakout)
3. **Multi-Asset Testing:** Test on BTC, ETH, PAXG, others (not just one pair)
4. **Monthly Refresh:** Kill bottom 2 Testing bots, add 2 new discoveries
5. **External Sources:** Scrape TradingView, QuantConnect, not just GitHub

**Confidence Level:** High - with continuous discovery, always have fresh candidates

---

### Risk 4: System Complexity Causes Bugs

**Problem:** Automation breaks, bots crash, trades execute incorrectly, data corruption.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Phased Rollout:** Test each phase for 30+ days before moving to next
2. **Extensive Logging:** Log every automation decision to database
3. **Monitoring Alerts:** Telegram notifications for all automation events
4. **Weekly Human Review:** Review all auto-decisions every Sunday
5. **Emergency Kill Switch:** Telegram command `/pause-all-automation`
6. **Micro Capital Testing:** Start Live tier with only $100-500 per strategy
7. **Rollback Plan:** Keep previous config versions, can revert in minutes

**Confidence Level:** Medium - complexity is real, but standard DevOps practices help

---

### Risk 5: Capital Loss from Bad Promotions

**Problem:** Testing bot looks good in dry-run but loses money when promoted to Live.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Live Micro Tier:** New promotions start with $100-500 only (not full $3,000)
2. **30-Day Probation:** Must prove profitability in Live Micro before scaling
3. **Strict Promotion Criteria:** Require 60 days dry-run + 4 weeks outperformance
4. **Correlation Check:** Ensure <0.7 correlation with existing Live strategies
5. **Monthly Capital Review:** Adjust allocations based on recent performance
6. **Max Loss Limit:** Auto-demote if Live Micro loses >10% in first month

**Confidence Level:** High - tiered testing significantly reduces risk

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Start Small (RECOMMENDED)

**Timeline:** 6-8 months incremental
**Risk:** Low - validate each phase before next
**Effort:** 60-85 hours total

**Steps:**

1. **Now → Oct 28:** Let current 6 bots accumulate data (no changes)

2. **Oct 28 Analysis:** Review performance, identify top 3 strategies
   - Top 3 → designated as "Live" candidates
   - Bottom 3 → move to "Testing" pool (dry-run mode)

3. **Nov-Dec 2025:** Build Phase 1 (Auto-pause system)
   - 2-3 weeks development (10-15 hours)
   - 1 month validation (run alongside manual monitoring)
   - Tune pause thresholds based on real data

4. **Jan-Feb 2026:** Build Phase 2 (Testing pipeline)
   - Upgrade VPS to 8GB RAM
   - Add 4 more dry-run bots (total: 3 Live + 7 Testing)
   - Implement semi-automated rotation (human approval required)

5. **Mar-Apr 2026:** Build Phase 3 (Strategy mining)
   - Scrape GitHub weekly for new strategies
   - Auto-backtest and rank candidates
   - Promote top performers to Testing pool

6. **May-Jun 2026:** Build Phase 4 (Full automation)
   - Remove human approval requirement
   - Add safety guardrails and kill switches
   - Weekly/monthly automated reporting

7. **Jul 2026+:** Iterate and scale
   - Optionally upgrade to 16GB VPS (20 bots)
   - Add genetic algorithm (evolve custom strategies)
   - Expand to more trading pairs (ETH, BNB, etc.)

**Decision Points:**

- After Phase 1: Did auto-pause catch any real degradation? Tune thresholds.
- After Phase 2: Are Testing bots generating good candidates? If not, improve sourcing.
- After Phase 3: Is mining finding enough strategies? If not, add GA.
- After Phase 4: System stable for 3 months? Consider scaling to 20 bots.

### Option 2: Aggressive Build (Higher Risk)

**Timeline:** 3-4 months compressed
**Risk:** Medium - less validation time
**Effort:** Same 60-85 hours, compressed schedule

**Steps:**

1. **Oct 28:** Immediately start Phase 1 (auto-pause)
2. **Nov:** Complete Phase 1 + start Phase 2 simultaneously
3. **Dec:** Upgrade VPS, deploy 10 bots (3 Live + 7 Testing)
4. **Jan 2026:** Build Phase 3 (strategy mining) in parallel with testing
5. **Feb 2026:** Full automation (Phase 4) go-live

**Pros:** Faster time to value, adaptive system running by Q1 2026
**Cons:** Less validation time, higher risk of bugs, more stressful development

### Option 3: Research-Only Agent (Alternative)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Risk:** Very Low
**Effort:** 5-10 hours

If not ready to build the full system yet, create a **`strategy-research-specialist`** agent:

**Functionality:**
- Reads latest quantitative trading papers weekly
- Monitors trading blogs (QuantStart, Quantified Strategies, etc.)
- Scrapes GitHub for trending freqtrade strategies
- Identifies promising techniques
- Proposes strategy ideas for manual implementation
- No execution, just research and recommendations

**Output:** Weekly report with 3-5 strategy ideas, links to sources, rationale

**Benefit:** Continuous learning, low commitment, builds knowledge base for future automation

## Conclusion

The adaptive self-optimizing trading system is **feasible, well-researched, and 80% ready** based on existing infrastructure. The recommended path is **Option 1 (Start Small)** with a 6-8 month incremental build.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Now:** Let 6 bots run until Oct 28 as planned
2. **Oct 28:** Analyze results, pick top 3 → Live pool
3. **Nov 2025:** Decision point - start Phase 1 or wait longer?

**Expected ROI:**

Even one consistently profitable strategy discovered by automation (5-10% annual return) pays for the entire infrastructure investment. With continuous discovery generating 10-20 candidates per month, probability of finding multiple winners is high.

**Key Success Factors:**

- Phased approach with validation at each step
- Strong existing agent infrastructure (80% ready)
- Industry-proven techniques (walk-forward, GAs, regime detection)
- Comprehensive risk mitigation at every phase
- Human oversight maintained until system proves reliable

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.** Build incrementally, validate thoroughly, scale confidently.
