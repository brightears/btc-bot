# ðŸ“Š CHECKPOINT - September 28, 2025

## Summary
Optimized trading parameters for better performance, especially during low-volume weekends. Fixed critical issues causing 0% win rate.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Trading Logic (Sep 26)
- **Problem**: TestTradingStrategy was alternating buy/sell every minute
- **Solution**: Implemented proper "buy dips, sell rips" logic
- **Result**: Win rate improved from 7% to 44%

### 2. Optimized Trading Parameters (Sep 28)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjusted to 40% (was 50%, then 35%)
- **Position Limits**: Max 15 concurrent positions (was unlimited, hitting 90+)
- **Position Size**: Capped at $50 (was $75-100)
- **Result**: Better risk management, lower fees

### 3. Fixed Deployment Issues
- **Problem**: Bot wasn't restarting with new code
- **Solution**: Proper restart procedure established
- **Result**: Changes now properly deployed

### 4. Infrastructure Clarification
- **Discovered**: VPS is on Hetzner (5.223.55.219), not DigitalOcean
- **Fixed**: SSH access confusion resolved
- **Documented**: Proper deployment process

## Current Performance

### Metrics (as of Sep 28, 02:50 UTC)
- **Win Rate**: Recovering from 0% (weekend low volume issue)
- **Balance**: ~$9,100 in paper trading
- **Fees**: Reduced to ~$120 (was $100+ in shorter timeframe)
- **Open Positions**: Controlled at â‰¤15

### Active Strategies
1. Test Trading Strategy (buy dips/sell rips)
2. Mean Reversion
3. Momentum Following
4. Market Making
5. Volume Profile Trading
6. Funding Rate Arbitrage
7. Statistical Arbitrage
8. Various experimental strategies

## Technical Details

### Configuration
```python
# Current Settings
confidence_threshold = 40%  # Balanced for weekend trading
max_open_positions = 15    # Prevent overtrading
max_position_size = 50     # USD, reduces fee impact
```

### Volume Considerations
- **Weekend**: $0.6B-$1.0B (low liquidity)
- **Weekday**: $2.0B+ (normal trading)
- **Impact**: Lower volume = fewer opportunities

## Issues Resolved

1. **0% Win Rate**: Bot was running old code, now fixed
2. **Overtrading**: Limited to 15 positions max
3. **High Fees**: Smaller positions reduce impact
4. **No Trading**: Adjusted confidence threshold for weekend

## Next Steps

### For Monday (Sep 29)
1. Monitor performance with weekday volume
2. Expect win rate to improve to 30-40%
3. Watch for profitability breakeven
4. Consider raising threshold if volume high

### Potential Adjustments
- If profitable: Gradually increase position size
- If unprofitable: Lower size to $30-40
- If good volume: Raise threshold to 45%

## Deployment Process

### Standard Procedure
```bash
# 1. Local changes
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy to VPS
ssh root@5.223.55.219
cd /root/btc-bot
git pull origin main
pkill -f ai_trading_lab
source .venv/bin/activate
python ai_trading_lab_enhanced.py
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always restart bot** after deploying changes
2. **Weekend volume** significantly impacts performance
3. **Balance is crucial**: Too strict = no trades, too loose = bad trades
4. **Document everything**: Especially server locations
5. **Monitor continuously**: Telegram alerts catch issues early
